- Raw sequnecing data availible at NCBI bioproject PRJNA1255528 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA1255528)
- Taxonomic classification with MiDAS 5.3 down to genus level  
- Diversity and abundance analysis 
- Phylogenetic tree construction using IQ-TREE  
- Analysis of the extracted EPS from the across global activated sludge samples including: 
	- EPS yield analysis 
	- EPS protein and polysaccharide content
	- FTIR spectra and PCA of the EPS
